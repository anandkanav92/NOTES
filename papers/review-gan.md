# Paper review - GAN

The purpose of the study was to evaluate different GAN algorithms and determine the possible differences in the overall performance among these algorithms. Various GAN algorithms have been introduced recently \footnote{https://github.com/hindupuravinash/the-gan-zoo}, and majority of them have managed to achieve notable results. The paper designed the experiments and common metrics to test prominent GAN algorithms on on neutral grounds. The resu
