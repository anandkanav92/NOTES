# Paper review - GAN

The purpose of the study was to evaluate different GAN algorithms and determine the possible differences in the overall performance among these algorithms. Various GAN algorithms have been introduced recently \footnote{https://github.com/hindupuravinash/the-gan-zoo}, and majority of them have managed to achieve notable results. The paper designed the experiments and common metrics to test prominent GAN algorithms on neutral grounds. The results showed that if trained for long enough, all these algorithms achieve similar performance level and no modified GAN algorithms consistently outperforms the non-saturating GAN(Vanilla GAN).

# write about experiments
The researchers thoroughly explained the experiment design choices and parameters considered. The architecture, taken from INFO GAN, is used for all algorithms since none of these algorithm were designed to specifically work with this architecture. Other important experimental dimension explored is Hyperparameters. Since it is not feasible to explore complete domains of each hyperparameter, authors limits it by following two approaches. First, a hyperparameter are optimized for each data set (using random search) and other
