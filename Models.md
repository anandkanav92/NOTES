# GAN

### Why generative modelling?
- To predict future i.e all the scenarios and could be used in reinforcement learning.
- Semi supervised learning to predict missing data
- Mutli modal outputs - for applications with multiple possible outputs.
- realistic generation â€ asks, generating images or audio waveforms.
