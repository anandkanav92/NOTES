# musts
1.  be organized around and related directly to the thesis or research question you are developing
2.  synthesize results into a summary of what is and is not known
3.  identify areas of controversy in the literature
4.  formulate questions that need further research
# TIPS
-   Review the abstracts of research studies carefully. This will save you time.
-   Write down the searches you conduct in each database so that you may duplicate them if you need to later (or avoid dead-end searches  that you'd forgotten you'd already tried).
-   Use the bibliographies and references of research studies you find to locate others.
-   Ask your professor or a scholar in the field if you are missing any key works in the field.
-   Use  [RefWorks](https://refworks.proquest.com/)  to keep track of your research citations. See the  [RefWorks Tutorial](http://libguides.uwf.edu/refworks)  if you need help.
# Questions to ask while reviewing paper
-   What was the research question of the study you are reviewing? What were the authors trying to discover?
-   Was the research funded by a source that could influence the findings?
-   What were the research methodologies? Analyze its literature review, the samples and variables used, the results, and the conclusions. Does the research seem to be complete? Could it have been conducted more soundly? What further questions does it raise?
-   If there are conflicting studies, why do you think that is?
-   How are the authors viewed in the field? Has this study been cited?; if so, how has it been analyzed?
