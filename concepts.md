# ANOVA
- Anova is statistical concept used to gather the relationships between multiple groups. 
- It uses F ratio to either accept or reject the hypothesis that all the different groups have same mean and do not vary from each other beyond a certain threshhold.
$$ Fscore = \frac{SSB*1/DOF}{SSW*1/DOF} $$
where, SSB = sum of squares difference between the groups and SSW = sum of squares difference within the group.
- DOF is calculated by checking number of unknown variables - 1 (because we know mean and hence easy to find the last value of the group)
