# Lecture 1

- History stuff. Nothing important but good introductions.
- 2012 was the year of alexa net. 
- Neural architecture existed for long time but lack of resources and data made it difficult to predict.
- 2001 adaboost was used for face detection :O 

# Lecture 2
- Talks about KNN, L1, L2 and linear classifiers
- L1 is dependent on your coordinate system. So if values depict some special pre defined meaning, it is good to use L1. L1 has corners while L2 is a sphere.
