`Strings`
---
- immutable - once created cannot be changes
- unlike java, python doesn't convert variable to string when used with `+` operator. Use `str` instead.
- A raw string can be specified `raw = r'this\t\n and that'  will print this\t\n and that`
- The slice `s[start:end]` is the elements beginning at start and extending up to but not including end.

` List`
---
- The "empty list" is just an empty pair of brackets [ ]. The '+' works to append two lists, so [1, 2] + [3, 4] yields [1, 2, 3, 4] (this is just like + with strings).
