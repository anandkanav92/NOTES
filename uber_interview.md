**`Generate all combinations`** 🈺
 > Given a string containing digits from 2-9 inclusive, return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent. A mapping of digit to letters (just like on the telephone buttons) is given below. Note that 1 does not map to any letters.

- Create a mapping from number to set of letters.
- For each number, for loop over every mapping one by one. if len == digits given (or len of digits == 0) add the combination

- Use this diff as key and group every string.
- o(nk) and space o(nk)

**`23. Merge k Sorted Lists`** 🚴

- Use priority queue which uses min heap to keeo the data in sorted way. o(nlogn)
- other possible way is to merge two arrays at once and combine them. o(logn) times o(n) for merging two arrays into one.


```python
from Queue import PriorityQueue

**`29. Decode ways`** 🚹
>A message containing letters from A-Z is being encoded to numbers using the following mapping:

- DP problem. Similar to stair problem where you can take either 1 or more steps, or game problem where you play with other person.
- For every step, you can pick one or two strings and validate if it could be mapped to our criteria. If it reaches end, that means all the below ones had valid combinations.
- In DP, you have runtime = number of unique states/parameter X time taken for each state. In this case, each state is O(1) and unique states are n, so O(n) with O(n) space.


```python
def numDecodings(self, s: str) -> int:
        if not s:
            return None
        if int(s[0])==0:

**`104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree`** 🌲

- do a post traversal and for each level do a +1. If root is none, return -1, as we did a +1 for every level first even when the level doesn't exist.

```python

**`133. Clone Graph`** 🉐
>Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph. Return a deep copy (clone) of the graph.

- question is asking to do a dfs of a graph, and make a copy of the current graph and return.
- create a dict with key as val and containing list to neighbors.
- start with 1 and do dfs and keep creating new node when encountered for the first time, otherwise ad neighbors. simple code below.

```python
def cloneGraph(self, node: 'Node') -> 'Node':
    if not node:
        return node
    root = Node(node.val)
    stack = [node]
    visit = {}
    visit[node.val] = root
    while stack:
        top = stack.pop()

        for n in top.neighbors:
            if n.val not in visit:
                stack.append(n)
                visit[n.val] = Node(n.val)

**`138. Copy List with Random Pointer`** 🍴
>A linked list is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer which could point to any node in the list or null.

- Similar to clone graph. make a dict looking out for any future declaration of nodes in next and random pointer. Important twist is to make a dict on full node rather than just value asvalue will be repeated. 


```python
    def copyRandomList(self, head: 'Node') -> 'Node':

        while head:
            if head not in visited:

            if head.next and head.next not in visited:
                
                visited[head.next] = Node(head.next.val)
            
            if head.next:

**`Min value in a stack`** 📭
>getMin() -- Retrieve the minimum element in the stack.

- Very good technique is to store a tuple in the stack, storing the minimum value at that point inside the stack. update everytime you enter the new value in stack.


```python
    def push(self, x):
        """
        :type x: int
        :rtype: nothing
        """
        if not self.stack:
            self.stack.append((x,x)) 
        else:
            self.stack.append((x,min(x,self.stack[-1][1])))
```
