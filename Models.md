# GAN

### Why generative modelling?
- To predict future i.e all the scenarios and could be used in reinforcement learning.
- Semi supervised learning to predict missing data
- Mutli modal outputs - for applications with multiple possible outputs.
- realistic generation tasks, generating images or audio waveforms.

### What is GAN?
- (GAN) has shown great results in many generative tasks to replicate the real-world rich content such as images, human language, and music.
- It is inspired by game theory: two models, a generator and a critic, are competing with each other while making each other stronger at the same time.
