# musts
1.  be organized around and related directly to the thesis or research question you are developing
2.  synthesize results into a summary of what is and is not known
3.  identify areas of controversy in the literature
4.  formulate questions that need further research
# TIPS
-   Review the abstracts of research studies carefully. This will save you time.
-   Write down the searches you conduct in each database so that you may duplicate them if you need to later (or avoid dead-end searches  that you'd forgotten you'd already tried).
-   Use the bibliographies and references of research studies you find to locate others.
-   Ask your professor or a scholar in the field if you are missing any key works in the field.
-   Use  [RefWorks](https://refworks.proquest.com/)  to keep track of your research citations. See the  [RefWorks Tutorial](http://libguides.uwf.edu/refworks)  if you need help.
