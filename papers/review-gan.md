 # Paper review - GAN 
  The purpose of the study was to evaluate different GAN algorithms and determine the possible differences in the overall performance among these algorithms. Various GAN algorithms have been introduced recently \footnote{https://github.com/hindupuravinash/the-gan-zoo}, and a majority of them have managed to achieve notable results. The paper designed the experiments and common metrics to test prominent GAN algorithms on neutral grounds. The results showed that if trained for long enough, all these algorithms achieve similar performance level and no modified GAN algorithms consistently outperform the non-saturating GAN(Vanilla GAN). 
   # write about experiments 
   The researchers thoroughly explain the experiment design choices. The architecture, taken from INFO GAN, is used for all algorithms since none of these algorithms were designed to specifically work with this architecture. As it is infeasible to explore complete domains of each hyperparameter, authors limit it by following two approaches. First, hyperparameters are optimized for each data set (using random search) and other
