 # Paper review - GAN 
  The purpose of the study was to evaluate different GAN algorithms and determine the possible differences in the overall performance among these algorithms. Various GAN algorithms have been introduced recently \footnote{https://github.com/hindupuravinash/the-gan-zoo}, and a majority of them have managed to achieve notable results. The paper designed the experiments and common metrics to test prominent GAN algorithms on neutral grounds. The results showed that if trained for long enough, all these algorithms achieve similar performance level and no modified GAN algorithms consistently outperform the non-saturating GAN(Vanilla GAN). 
  # write about metrics used 

   # write about experiments 
   The researchers thoroughly explain the experiment design choices. The architecture, taken from INFO GAN, is used for all algorithms since none of these algorithms were designed to specifically work with this architecture. As it is infeasible to explore complete domains of each hyperparameter, authors limit it by following two approaches. First, hyperparameters are optimized for each data set (using random search) and other

Article Summary
Problem

What affect does an 8-week instructional period have on the sight-reading skills on a beginning choir singer, and how does technology as well as previous experience affect the skills obtained during the instruction?

# Goals

The main goal of this study to provide a rich comparison of major GAN algorithms and identify which algorithms performs better(or worse)  than others. 

# Specific Research Questions

1. Which of the many GAN algorithm outperform others(If any)?
2. Is FID robust  to be used as  a model  ?
3. 
4. Is there a significant difference in the sight-reading skills gained by beginning choir students in a technology instructional period versus a no technology instructional period?
5. Is there a significant difference in the sight-reading skills gained by students with previous choral experience or applied music instruction during an instructional period versus students without a prior background in music?

# Hypothesis

There doesn’t appear to be any hypothesis mentioned for this research study.  The study appears to be seeking answers to the question above and doesn’t seem to have any preconceived notions about what the results will be.
