## An Efficient Approach for Assessing Hyperparameter Importance
#### Summary
- The paper tried to find the impact of each hyperparameter on the overall performance of the given model. It uses the perfromance data and fits random forest model to make decisions trees based on gathered data. These trees are used to calculate the importance of each hyperparameter in general setting using ANOVA framework.
- The key idea behind our algorithm is to exploit the fact that each of the regression trees in a given forest defines a partitioning P of the configuration space Θ, with piecewise constant predictions ci in each Pi ∈ P, and that the problem of computing sums over an arbitrary number of configura- tions thus reduces to the problem of identifying the ratio of configurations that fall into each partition.
